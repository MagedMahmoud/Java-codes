Deliverables
============

A zipfile containing:

* `MultiThread.java` (edited)
* `SingleThread.java` (edited)
* `ImagePanel.java` (unedited)
* Whatever images you need to include.

Instructions
============

Multi Thread
------------

In `MultiThread.java` build on the included code so that there are three image panels and three threads, one thread per image panel.  The first thread should change the image in the first image panel every second, the second thread should change the image in the second image panel every two seconds, and the third thread should change the image in the third image panel every three seconds.  Each image panel should cycle through at least three images.

Single Thread
-------------

In `SingleThread.java` build on the included code so that there are three image panels.  Every second change the image in the first image panel, every two seconds change the image in the second image panel, and every three seconds change the image in the second image panel.  Do not use multiple threads to do this, all changes must be made from the main thread.
